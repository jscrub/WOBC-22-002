If anyone is interested in developing their web application pentesting skills I have made my lin-ops into a webserver hosting OWASPS Juice Shop webapp. Feel free to test it out and let me know if it goes down, I'll spin it back up.
 
JuiceShop IP: 10.50.40.171:3000
 
Do not send any DOS/DDOS attacks at the webapp as this will break it.

*Linux PAM backdoor video walkthrough*
    


Hi everyone. We didn’t get to see the Linux PAM backdoor in action during CCTC, so I’ve made a 10-min video showing you how to do it. It is yet another method in your toolkit IOT maintain access and very likely escalate privileges through another user with more permissions. It’s actually not that hard once you know how to do it. It took me a lot longer just trying to figure out how to get the code to compile.

Enjoy!

Note: This video file is almost 1 GB in size, so I’ve also included a private/unlisted YouTube link here for easier access: https://youtu.be/OnBrxfp7OsM
