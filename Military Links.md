## Instructions:
You must register for a SANS On Demand Course that is in the approved list (see attached). You must also use your .mil address to register. NOTE: If you have a SANS civilian account, it is advised to merge it into your mil account (SANS can do this for you) for the duration of your military career and/or using Army Ignited.

Once registered, you must generate an Invoice from SANS. Download the Invoice. Send the Invoice to 
-Deb Taylor

-DTaylor@sans.org < Caution-mailto:DTaylor@sans.org >

She will reduce the cost to exactly $4,000 dollars. This Invoice will be used to upload to Army Ignited.

Army Ignited site: https://www.armyignited.com/app/student/homepage

In Army Ignited, you will requesting Credentialing Assistance and search for the course (NOT THE CERT) and register. During registration, there will be a need to upload that adjusted Invoice. NOTE: Your course needs to be scheduled 30 days out. Army Ignited takes its time to approve.

Once approved, SANS will email you once payment is completed to have your On Demand Course start.

NOTE: You will have to pay for the Cert attempt and practice test OUT OF POCKET or by other means. Army Ignited does not cover those costs. If you register for a bundle request within 30 days (aka buy the cert attempt with the practice tests), it will be a reduced cost of $949 instead of the standard $1149. The unit may or may not pay this.
