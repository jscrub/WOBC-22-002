### Event Standards and Background

The Norwegian Foot March, or Marsjmerket, was introduced in 1915 as a culminating training event for new conscripts and infantry soldiers. Traditionally, the event simulated overnight movement by a dismounted light infantry element. The element would occupy attack positions prior to daybreak and attack its objective at first light, fighting until it was successfully seized and only resting after consolidating its gains later that evening. The modern version of the march attempts to replicate this experience with the following requirements:

1.    Complete the 18.6 mile / 30 kilometer course in the time allocated to their age/gender (see time standards below)
2.    Complete the foot march using an issued or military-style ruck weighing a minimum of 11 kilograms / 25 pounds (dry weight). Alternatively, units can also require participants to carry their assigned weapon during the event. If carried, the total weight of the weapon and ruck must equal at least 11 kilograms / 25 pounds. The carrying of assigned weapons plus ruck is the preferred variant of the event.
3.    Complete the event prior to the start of Begin Morning Nautical Twilight (BMNT)
4.    Fulfill official duties for a full duty day following the completion of the event

Participant Time Standards
Age Group	Male Time Standard (hh:mm)	Female Time Standard (hh:mm)
18-34	4:30	4:50
35-42	4:35	5:00
43-49	4:40	5:15
50-54	4:50	5:30
55-59	5:00	5:45
60+	    5:15    6:00

Additional Event Requirements
1.    Military participants must wear their duty uniform and boots. The civilian uniform is at the discretion of the organizer, but must be at least 1.5 kilograms / 3.3 pounds in weight.
2.    Participants must be weigh their rucks (a standard weight for carried weapons can be established by the unit) prior to and after completing the event to ensure they fulfill the weight requirements
3.    An official clock or timer is displayed at the start and finish line or a designated timer calls out the official time for participants and graders
4.    Graders record each participant's finish time, starting ruck/weapon weight, and finishing ruck/weapon weight on an official roster
5.    Event organizers must establish manned medical and water stations every 3.2 kilometers / 2 miles along the length of the course
6.    Organizers create a medical evacuation plan based upon local conditions and potential issues
7.    Conducted between -15 to 25 Celsius (5 to 77 Fahrenheit) and under no extreme weather conditions
8.    The event occurs on unimproved roads or trails (waivable depending on location)

## International Four Days Marches Nijmegen
This is a Foreign event; you will need to be in Nijmegen, Netherlands to complete this event.
Yearly hosted in July (typically 2nd or 3rd week of July)
Next Event: 105th edition: July 18 - July 21, 2023
https://www.4daagse.nl/en/participation/military-individual/registration

To earn the military badge, you MUST complete it in military gear.
USA Delegation contact for registration:
USA, Michael Walley: Usdodmil.4daagse@gmail.com

Age Variant:
Born in 2004-2010: Can do the 40km with or without kit
Born in 1973-2003: MUST do the 40km with kit. Kit is 10 kilos (22-25 lbs dry)

Each day, military participants walk 40km per day with their kit and uniform. Participants have 12 hours to complete the walk each day. MIL participants start in Camp Huemensoord, slightly south of Nijmegen.

Accomodations: See the official site for more info. You can be hosted with a family as needed.

Cost: expect a nominal fee for registration. Lask checked is 95 Euros (subject to be different depending on circumstances).

Rewards:
Cross of the Four Day Marches (Vierdaagsekruis)

Recommended travel as per a redditor:
I would encourage you to travel by train if you can. If you must fly (e.g. if you're traveling from North America) then one option is to fly to Schiphol (AMS) and take a direct train to Nijmegen from there, or change trains in Utrecht. There are four trains an hour, two of which are direct, and you don't need to reserve a train or seat - you just need a ticket to Nijmegen which will then be valid on any (domestic) train that goes there.

The other option is to fly to Weeze airport, which is closer to Nijmegen (across the German border) but much smaller than Schiphol so not as many direct flights there (esp. long-haul). And while it is geographically closer, its connection to Nijmegen via public transit isn't as good and and will actually take at least as long as from Schiphol (and likely longer), with more transfers (at least two, with the first leg by bus).

To get around town the best option in my opinion would be to rent a bike (which will give you the most mobility and flexibility), but you can also get around by bus very easily.


## Luxembourg March (International March of Diekirch)
NOTE: This badge is under scrutiny and NRC has stated this award is NOT AUTHORIZED. Take it as you will.

Holland Four Day Event Cross & International March of Diekirch Medal Updated to Token Acceptance Only ***UPDATE Dennis Christensen Copper Member Dennis Christensen Sep 7, 2022 6:53 AM This post is an update to our previous post titled “Holland Four Day Event Cross & International March of Diekirch Medal Updated to Token Acceptance Only,” dated 31 August 2022.***

Soldiers are welcome to participate in these events in the virtual format they are currently being offered. However, Soldiers must still meet badging requirements as outlined in AR 600-8-22, Chapter 9 and Army Directive 2021-20. Commanders or DCGs serving in the rank of BG/O–7 or above are delegated authority to approve the acceptance, retention, and permanent wear of these foreign badges. This authority may be further delegated to commanders at headquarters charged with custody of the AMHRR. The burden of proof rests on the individual Soldier to produce valid justification, that is: orders, citations, or other original copies of the foreign elements that awarded them the badge.

The Awards and Decorations Branch (ADB) is coordinating with OSD, and the Luxembourg and Netherlands Embassies regarding these events and associated awards to ensure they meet DoD and Army regulatory requirements. Upon completion of this staffing effort, ADB will publish additional guidance.

BLUF: The International March of Diekirch (possible Diekrich, I've seen different spellings) is virtual this year and authorizes US Army SMs to participate and be awarded a foreign ribbon for walking (no ruck) 1x20km, 2x20km, 1x40km, or 2x40km over 1-2 days before the suspense of October 31st.

I have compiled the details for the International March of Diekirch (which is virtual this year) for reference to any units who want to push this out to their SMs. Full disclosure, I have completed the event but have not received all certs/medals/ribbons for it as of this moment. This is the information I have compiled that I will use to attempt the event with my buddies. If there are any issues throughout the process, I will pull them all together in a follow-up, I encourage you to do your due diligence as well if you are hosting the event for your teams.

The March of Diekirch is an annual event hosted by Luxembourg where civilians and SMs across the world will participate in a 1 to 2 day march in honor of Luxembourg's 'John the Blind.' The march for the past 3 years has been conducted virtually which provides all of us a great opportunity to earn a foreign decoration. The (Diekirch) march team has authorized anybody to virtually complete the march between April 1st and October 31st, 2022.

You must:

Register for the event
Pay the registration fee (approx. $20)
Complete the march
Send in proof of march via email
Receive a medal/certificate of completion
Send up a memo for authorization of wear to first O-7
Order a US Army-authorized ribbon for the march

The event itself:
YOU MAY DO ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING

1x20km over the course of 1 day (medal, no decoration)
1x40km over the course of 1 day (medal w/ bomb)
2x20km over the course of 2 days (medal w/ bomb)
2x40km over the course of 2 days. (medal w/ canons)

20 km is approx. 12.5miles
40km is approx. 25miles

The event may be completed without a ruck, throughout an entire day, or any 2 days before November 1st. (October 31st is the deadline) While there is no mandate for a ruck, a backpack with water is highly recommended as well as a water refill plan as this event at a 15min/mile pace would take about 6.25 hours. The march can be broken up into multiple legs over an entire day so long as the total 20km or 40km is completed within that 0000-2359 period you're good.

The event should be recorded by a GPS or similar app on a phone (like Strava). This would be sent to the march team as proof of completion. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a GPS or similar system on your phone you may instead send a detailed analysis of your run to the march team for proof.

Award:
International March of Diekirch ribbon. Note this ribbon, regardless if you have additional accolades or not, is worn bare. As in, you do not have any decorations on it within your Award rack.
IRA Green is the only website that seems to have a copy of the authorized size award.
